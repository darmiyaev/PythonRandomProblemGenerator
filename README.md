# PythonRandomProblemGenerator
# What is this
This gives you random problems from Python, you can also select them yourself.
# Features
Over 40 problems.

Over 170 lines of code.
# Why was this made?
I have been programming for a long time, but I keep on forgetting my syntax.

I thought of this, this helps me practice Python and keeps me refreshed.
# Will this be updated, how about for new Python versions
Yes, this will be updated.

The version Python is at the time this was written, is 3.8.3

This means that Python 4 will eventually come out.

When Python 4 comes out, I will probably update the problems and create new ones.
# When is this updated?
https://repl.it/@darmiyaev/PythonProblems#main.py is updated first.

This gets updated sometimes, i would estimate once a week, this is just a estimation, maybe not true.
# No libraries
No library problems are in this. 

Problems from librarys might be added :)
